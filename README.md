This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is integrated with Hardhat and Ethers, and is an NFT marketplace built with a variety of tools, including Tailwind CSS and Typescript

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Run the script above and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


You can check out [the deployed version](https://enefti.netlify.app), although i may not have pushed it onto the server yet. 
However, you can go through the detailed code in the reporitory, and see what i have done with it. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!

The smart contract, Marketplace, is the one that handles the actual buying of the NFTs, while the Minter contract is the ERC721 contract that actually mints the NFTs.

Both can be found in the `/contracts` folder.
